It is hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite amusing. Artwork is of good quality either.<br /><br />This short isn\\'t just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he\\'s trying to catch the mouse too, because \u00abthere\\'s only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that\\'s the cat that catches the mouse\u00bb.<br /><br />If you ask me, there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically \u00abI\\'m glad you\\'re enjoying the siesta\u00bb and that she hopes they\\'re satisfied because she ain\\'t, making the two cats gasp. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course that, even funnier than this, is when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (dumb!) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack her on the \"rear\" - lol. Naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad, she isn\\'t someone to mess with. But even Jerry doesn\\'t win this time, because he is expelled by her too.'}]"}]}
